## Contributing

Hey! Thanks for considering contributing to the repository. We'll formalize this as the repository matures, but for now we'll split the contribution process into two pathways you can take.

## Push Code

Take issues that seem interesting to you, implement them, and open a pull request!

## Create Issues

Coming with a good description of something you want added to the repository is also very valuable, and helps shape product vision.
